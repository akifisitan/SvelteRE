# Svelte-RE

## Intro

Complete version of the Real Estate listing website built as a single page application using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

- This project was built as an internship project in a week, helping grasp current frontend technologies used to consume Restful Web APIs like [one built for this project](https://github.com/akifisitan/RealEstateApp.Api/) specifically
